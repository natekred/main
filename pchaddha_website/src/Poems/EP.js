export const EPPoem = `A woman made perfect by perception.
Her quietness is resolution. 
Her hesitation, thought.
Her blue eyes are a summer breeze 
Reminiscent of a care-free childhood. 

She is always surrounded by friends,
Shields guarding her innocence, 
From the cruelty of the world. 

One day, she tells me a secret. 

---

It became a day on which perfection died. 
Not heroically flamed out in the battlefield protecting family, friends, and Love. 
But by a mistake encouraged by impulse, and made potent by a bottle of Crown.

A day on which a dirac delta, 
Spiked at perfection, 
Became a distribution, 
Centered between personal best and worst. 

A day on which soul mates became extinct, 
And good enough became the accepted standard.`;
