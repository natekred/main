export const americaTheGreatPoem = `It was the land of freedom. 
Miles of highway cutting through unexplored territory connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific.

It was land of communication.
New Yorkers and Texans connected by miles of cable through which messages and voice were heard at the speed of light.

It was the land of mobility, 
Connected by car, train, and plane. Each person had agency. 

Of course, nothing was as pretty as America in the 2010s. 
In its golden age.

Then something happened. 
Somehow a evilness was released into the wind that brought out the hate, which spent its days in the darkest caverns of the faculties. 
It helped it grow until that little speck become the cave itself. 

And so the highways, which before transported opportunity, now carried danger.
And the cables which carried messages of love and growth, cried messages of degeneracy.
And the transports, which before people together, segregated.

But this was the land of hope. 
And the flames of hope are not so easily quenched. 
Through the beaches of California, the sands of Nevada, the hills of Colarado, the plains of Montana, the streets of New York, and the shores of Delaware, these flames grow.
Ready to wipe off the petina from Golden America, and make her beauty once again visible for all to see.`;
