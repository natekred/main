This will be the biggest fight of our lives. A last chance.
We fight for our freedom, our friends, our family. 
We fight for those no longer. We fight for those yet to come.

Believe in yourself. Trust your instincts. Stay sharp. Stay safe.  
Pay attention of your sorroundings. This won't be easy.
You may be pushed harder than you ever have been before. 
Do not give up. I am counting on you. We all are.  

Turn to your teammates now. You must trust them completely.
For your sake. For their sake. Protect each other. Protect us. 
Your team trusts you. Do not take that privelage lightly.
We all trust you. Uphold that responsiblity.   

Are you ready? You can do this. We will win. We have to.
There's no other option...
