export const busPoem = `As this bus came to a halt, at the local station,
Two passengers,
Their movements slowed, 
Their expressions grotesque, 
Made their way to the back.

It seemed as if they knew that they were an afterthought, 
that they did not belong in the front, 
that they were ghosts. 

The male unhooked his backpack, setting it onto the floor of the bus.
The female let go of the two worn-out recyclable bags that she carried.
They sat there, quiet and absolute, not uttering a single word to each other.

The bus fell into a rhythmic pattern.
Its movements become the beat of each palpitating heart.
And with each beat, the female slowly tilted her head towards the man’s shoulder.
It was as if her body was a petrified fluid, such that each stop on the bus,
Acted like a chisel
Whose periodic strikes 
Relieved her body from rigidness. 

Finally, her head lay on the man’s shoulder:
And a twinkle of light encased her demeanour. 
The man,
Who a moment ago looked a statue incapable of emotion, 
Now stroked her hair, 
Radiating warmth and emotion from his eyes.

His dull, worn out, light-blue jeans and her ripped-apart Canada-Goose jacket,
Could not, at that moment, hide from the world,
Their love for each other. 

Had the gloominess of the winter night,
The dank of the bus,
And the stereotype of their appearance not been there,
It would have been impossible to see, 
That their love for each other was unconditional and beautiful:
The most beautiful part of each of them.`;
